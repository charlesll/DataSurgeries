## Submitting a Topic

If you've got a topic you'd like to discuss in a Data Surgery, please fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/M94YdBKPSjrihfYi1), and we'll be in touch.

## Getting these examples

If you want to work with these notebooks on your own computer, you have two options:

1. By downloading [one-off zip file](https://github.com/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries/archive/master.zip), which contains everything up to this point. You'll have to re-download the file to get updates.

2. **[Recommended]** Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository to your computer. Once Git is installed, open a terminal, and type:

    `git clone https://github.com/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries.git path/to/where/you/want/to/save/it`

    To clone the respository on your computer. To get updates in future, open a terminal windoe, `cd` into the directory where you cloned the repository, and and run `git pull` to get all updates from the web.
