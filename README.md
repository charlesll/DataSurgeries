# RSES Data Surgeries Resources

A variety of Jupyter Notebooks made during the RSES data surgeries sessions.

## Contents

- [01_Intro](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries/blob/master/01_Intro/Intro_to_Python_and_Jupyter.ipynb): A brief introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and how to install and use them.

## Submitting a Topic

If you've got a topic you'd like to discuss in a Data Surgery, please fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/M94YdBKPSjrihfYi1), and we'll be in touch.

## Getting these examples

If you want to work with these notebooks on your own computer, you have two options:

1. ***Recommended.*** Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to 'clone' the repository to your computer. You can either use your favourite [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis), or open a terminal and run:

    `git clone https://github.com/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries.git path/to/where/you/want/to/save/it`

    To get updates in future, open a terminal window, `cd` into the directory where you cloned the repository, and and run `git pull` to synchronise your local copy with the web.

2. Download a [one-off zip file](https://github.com/rses-datascience/DataSurgeries/archive/master.zip), which contains everything up to this point. You'll have to re-download the file to get updates in future.
